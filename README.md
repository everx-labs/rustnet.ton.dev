# Getting Started

## 1. System Requirements
| Configuration | CPU (threads) | RAM (GiB) | Storage (GiB) | Network (Gbit/s)|
|---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Minimum |48|64|1000|1| 

SSD/NVMe disks are obligatory.

## 2. Prerequisites
### 2.1 Set the Environment
Adjust (if needed) `rustnet.ton.dev/scripts/env.sh`:

Set `export DEPOOL_ENABLE=yes` in `env.sh` for a depool validator (an elector request is sent to a depool from a validator multisignature wallet).

Set `export DEPOOL_ENABLE=no` in `env.sh` for a direct staking validator (an elector request is sent from a multisignature wallet directly to the elector).
    
    cd rustnet.ton.dev/scripts/
    . ./env.sh 
    
> Note: Make sure to run the script as `. ./env.sh`, not `./env.sh`

### 2.2 Install Dependencies
`install_deps.sh` script supports Ubuntu OS only.

    ./install_deps.sh 
Install and configure Docker according to the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/). 

**Note**: Make sure to add your user to the docker group, or run subsequent command as superuser:

    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

## 3. Deploy RUST Validator Node
Do this step when the network is launched.
Deploy the node:

    ./deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee ./deploy.log

**Note**: the log generated by this command will be located in the rustnet.ton.dev/scripts/ folder and can be useful for troubleshooting.
  
Wait until the node is synced with the masterchain. Depending on network throughput this step may take significant time (up to several hours).

## 4. Check Node synchronization

Use the following command to check if the node is synced:

    docker exec -it rnode /ton-node/tools/console -C /ton-node/configs/console.json --cmd getstats

Script output example:
```
tonlabs console 0.1.0
COMMIT_ID: 0569a2bbb18c1ce966b1ac21cdf193dbd3c5817b
BUILD_DATE: 2021-01-15 19:11:52 +0000
COMMIT_DATE: 2021-01-15 16:26:58 +0300
GIT_BRANCH: master
{
  "masterchainblocktime": 1610742179,
  "masterchainblocknumber": 24191,
  "timediff": 5,
  "in_current_vset_p34": false,
  "in_next_vset_p36": false
}
```
If the `timediff` parameter equals a few seconds, synchronization is complete.

**Note**: The sync process may not start for up to one hour after node deployment, during which this command may result in error messages. If errors persist for more than an hour after deployment, review deployment log for errors and check the network status.

## 5. Configure validator multisignature wallet

There is a small difference between direct staking and DePool validators on this step:

- For direct staking validator it is necessary to create and deploy a validator [SafeMultisig](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig) wallet in `-1` chain.
- For a DePool validator it is necessary to create and deploy a validator [SafeMultisig](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig) wallet in `0` chain.

You can use [TONOS-CLI](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli) for this purpose. It should be [configured](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli) to connect to the rustnet.ton.dev network.

Refer to [this document](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#3-create-wallet) for the detailed wallet creation procedure, or follow the links in the short guide below:

1. All wallet custodians should [create seed phrases and public keys](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#31-create-seed-phrases-and-public-keys-for-all-custodians) for themselves. At least three custodians are recommended for validator wallet, one of which will be used by the validator node. All seed phrases should be kept secret by their owners and securely backed up.
2. The wallet deployer (who may or may not be one of the custodians) should gather the **public** keys from all custodians.
3. The wallet deployer should obtain [SafeMultisig contract code](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#22-download-contract-files) from the repository.
4. The wallet deployer should [generate deployment keys](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#32-generate-deployment-key-pair-file).
5. The wallet deployer should [generate validator wallet](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#33-generate-wallet-address) address: **in -1 chain for direct staking validator or in 0 chain for a DePool validator**.
6. Any user should [send at least 1 token](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#34-send-tokens-to-the-new-address-from-another-wallet) to the generated wallet address to create it in the blockchain.
7. The wallet deployer should [deploy the wallet](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#35-deploy-wallet-set-custodians) contact to the blockchain and set all gathered public keys as its custodians. At this step the number of custodian signatures required to make transactions from the wallet is also set (>=2 recommended for validator wallets). Deploy to  -1 chain for direct staking validator or to 0 chain for a DePool validator.
7. In case of direct staking, the funds for staking should be [transferred](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#46-create-transaction-online) to the newly created validator wallet.

Once the wallet is deployed, place 2 files on the validator node:

- `/ton-node/configs/${VALIDATOR_NAME}.addr` should contain validator multisignature wallet address in form `X:XXX...XXX` (the folder on the host is `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node/configs`) 
- `/ton-node/configs/keys/msig.keys.json` should contain validator multisignature custodian's keypair (the folder on the host is `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node/configs/keys/`)

The node will use the wallet address and the keys provided to it to generate election requests each validation cycle.

> **Note**: If the validator wallet requires more than 1 custodian signature to make transactions, make sure each transaction sent by the validator node is [confirmed](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/safemultisig#47-create-transaction-confirmation-online) by the required amount of custodians.
    
## 6. Configure DePool

For a DePool validator it is necessary to deploy a [DePool](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool) contract to workchain `0`.

You can use [TONOS-CLI](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli) for this purpose. It should be [configured](https://github.com/tonlabs/tonos-cli) to connect to the rustnet.ton.dev network.

Refer to [this document](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#depool) for the detailed DePool creation procedure, or follow the links in the short guide below:

1. [Obtain contract code](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#2-prepare-depool-and-supporting-smart-contracts) from the repository.
2. Generate [deployment keys](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#3-generate-deployment-keys).
3. Calculate [contract addresses](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#4-calculate-contract-addresses).
4. [Send tokens](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#5-send-coins-to-the-calculated-addresses) to the calculated addresses.
5. [Deploy contracts](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#6-deploy-contracts). Make sure to specify your validator wallet in the DePool contract at this step.
6. Configure DePool [state update method](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#7-configure-depool-state-update-method).

Once DePool is successfully deployed and configured to be regularly called to update its state, you can [make stakes](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#8-make-stakes) in it. Note that validator stakes must always exceed [validator assurance](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#61-deploy-depool-contract-to-the-basechain), otherwise DePool will not participate in elections.

Also note, that DePool and supporting contracts balance should be [monitored and kept positive at all times](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#11-maintain-positive-balance-on-depool-and-supplementary-contracts).

Once the validator wallet and the DePool are deployed, place 3 files on the validator node:

- `/ton-node/configs/${VALIDATOR_NAME}.addr` should contain validator multisignature wallet address in form `0:XXX...XXX` (the folder on the host is `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node/configs`)
- `/ton-node/configs/keys/msig.keys.json` should contain validator multisignature custodian's keypair (the folder on the host is `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node/configs/keys/`)
- `/ton-node/configs/depool.addr` should contain DePool address in form `0:XXX...XXX`  (the folder on the host is `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node/configs`)


The script generating validator election requests (directly through multisig wallet, or through DePool, depending on the setting selected on step 2.1) will run regularly, once the necessary addresses and keys are provided.


# Stopping, restarting and deleting the RUST Node

> **Note**: call docker-compose commands from the `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node`  folder.

To stop the node use the following command:

    docker-compose stop

To restart a stopped node use the following command:

    docker-compose restart

To delete the node use the following commands:

    docker-compose down
    git reset --hard origin/main
    git clean -ffdx

> **Warning**: all local files and changes will be deleted from the git tree.


# Updating the node

To update the node with minimal delay and without deletion of db and the node config first change `TON_NODE_GITHUB_COMMIT_ID` in `env.sh` script (also change `TON_NODE_TOOLS_GITHUB_COMMIT_ID` and `TONOS_CLI_GITHUB_COMMIT_ID` if necessary).
Then use the following command:

    ./update.sh

To fully update the node (with db and the node config removal), first delete it:

    docker-compose down
    git reset --hard origin/main
    git clean -ffdx

Then repeat steps 1-6 of this document. This will install the latest version of the node.

# Logging
## During deployment

It is highly recommended to record the full log during node deployment:

    ./deploy.sh 2>&1 | tee ./deploy.log

The log is saved to the `rustnet.ton.dev/scripts/` folder next to the deployment script and can be useful for troubleshooting.

## During operation

When operational, the node keeps a number of logs in the `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node/logs` folder.

Logs are generated with **log4rs** framework. For detailed documentation on it refer to https://docs.rs/log4rs/1.0.0/log4rs/.

Logging configuration is determined by the `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node/configs/log_cfg.yml` file. By default is contains the recommended configuration for the Rust node.

# Troubleshooting

Here are some solutions to frequently encountered problems.

## 1. Couldn’t connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localhost

This error occurs in two cases. Either the docker daemon isn't running, or current user doesn't have rights to access docker.

You can fix the rights issue either by running relevant commands as the superuser or adding the user to the `docker` group: 

    sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

Make sure to restart the system or log out and back in, for the new group settings to take effect.


## 2. thread 'main' panicked error when checking node synchronization

The following error may occur for a short time immediately after node deployment when attempting to [check synchronization](#4-check-node-synchronization):

    thread 'main' panicked at 'Can't create client: Os { code: 111, kind: ConnectionRefused, message: "Connection refused" }', bin/console.rs:454:59

Currently this is expected behavior, unless it persists **for more than a few minutes**. If it does persist, check network status at https://rustnet.ton.live/, and, if the network is up and running, review [deployment logs](#during-deployment) for errors.


## 3. Error executing command when checking node synchronization

The following error may occur for up to an hour after node deployment when attempting to [check synchronization](#4-check-node-synchronization):

    Error executing command: Error receiving answer: early eof bin/console.rs:296

Currently this is expected behavior, unless it persists **for more than one hour**. If it does persist, check network status at https://rustnet.ton.live/, and, if the network is up and running, review [deployment logs](#during-deployment) for errors.


## 4. Cannot stop/restart/remove node container

Make sure you are running all docker-compose commands from the `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node` folder.


## 5. Errors on repeated node deployment

Various errors are possible if node deployment is repeated without previously removing the node container and resetting the git branch.

To remove the node container run the following command from the `rustnet.ton.dev/docker-compose/ton-node` folder:

    docker-compose down

and reset the git branch:

    git reset --hard origin/main
    git clean -ffdx

This will remove all local files and changes. Only then may node [deployment](#21-set-the-environment) be repeated.

## 6. Database overflow
It's recommended to use SSD disks of at least 1 TB for the database.
If the database fills up the whole disk anyway, you can delete it, and resync the node:

1. Stop the Rust node and clean docker volumes:

       docker-compose down -v

2. Then start the rust node again:

       docker-compose up -d

This will start the node with the same configs but with a clean database.

## 7. DePool state not updating

It's recommended to send at least two [ticktocks](https://github.com/tonlabs/ton-labs-contracts/tree/master/solidity/depool#7-configure-depool-state-update-method) while the elections are open.
For rust node you can use the [provided](https://github.com/tonlabs/rustnet.ton.dev/blob/main/docker-compose/ton-node/scripts/send_depool_tick_tock.sh) ticktock script, which sends 5 ticktocks after the elections open.
